# Fractals

**Fractals** is an interactive web application designed to visualize and explore the beauty of fractals. This project leverages the HTML5 Canvas API and React (with TypeScript) to create an engaging platform for rendering and interacting with fractal patterns in real time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rendering**: Real-time rendering of fractals using the Canvas API.
- **Interactive Experience**: Zoom, pan, and explore intricate details of fractal patterns.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parameters to modify fractal shapes and designs.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SergioMir018/fractals
   cd fractals
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Development Goals

1. Implement fractal generation algorithms.
2. Add interactive controls (zooming, panning, parameter adjustments).
3. Optimize rendering performance for smooth interaction.

## Future Enhancements

- Add animation to fractals for dynamic visual effects.
- Implement a gallery to save and share fractal designs.
- Integrate WebGL for 3D fractal exploration.
